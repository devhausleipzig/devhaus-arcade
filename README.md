# Devhaus Arcade
A collection of grid-based games built by the Devhaus academy team using TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Vite, and vanilla DOM methods.

Each repo has two branches:
- A "basic" branch for a simpler version of the game that should be beginner friendly and explicitly should not contain any use of classes.
- A "advanced" branch that is arbitrarily sophisticated, intended to expose students to advanced design patterns.

## One Grid Game to Rule Them All
The "advanced" versions of each game are written with functional principles in mind. As a very visual demonstration of the power of functional programming, there is one additional game that showcases how it is possible to take the functional pieces from other games and abstract over them in a way allowing one to pick and choose which pieces they want. The result is a game building system where you can interpolate between the original games, creating new games to play that are some strange Frankenstein combination of the original games.
