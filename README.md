# Devhaus Arcade
A collection of grid-based games built by the Devhaus academy team using TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Vite, and vanilla DOM methods.

Each repo has two branches:
- A "basic" branch for a simpler version of the game that explicitly should not contain any use of classes.
- A "advanced" branch that is arbitrarily sophisticated, intended to expose students to advanced design patterns.
